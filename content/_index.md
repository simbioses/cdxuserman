# OSCAR CDX Interoperability User Manual

Welcome to the OSCAR CDX Interoperability User Manual. This document describes the functionality added to OSCAR for its Version 1 of Clinical Document eXchange (CDX) interoperability. There are of course several places where the existing implementation can be improved. Such improvements will be shipped in future versions of the software.
