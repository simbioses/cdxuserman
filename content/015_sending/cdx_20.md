E-referrals are created in the usual way (like normal “consultations”) . Of course, it is important to select a CDX-capable specialist as the “Consultant”. These specialists are clearly marked in the dropdown box with “(CDX)” (see below):

Attachments can be added to the e-Referral (see left side of window). Once the data on the referral has been entered completely, the e-referral can be sent using the “Submit and Save CDX e-Referral” button (top right).
