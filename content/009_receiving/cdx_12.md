The CDX Viewer shows a warning if the Import Engine failed to automatically match the document to a patient demographic record using the 4-point matching (last name, DOB, sex, HIN).
In this case, the user can manually search the EMR demographic records and link the document to a patient (see “Demographic Search” input and “Link” button below).
