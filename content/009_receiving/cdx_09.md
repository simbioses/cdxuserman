- Similar to other documents and labs, the Inbox shows **patient name, number and gender**.
- **Result status** is **not** currently shown.
    - (⚠️ if the CDX document is a lab result, the result status is NOT displayed in the Inbox view. Consequently, the colour is NOT changed to red for an abnormal result.)
- The “**Date of Test**” column shows the **Observation Date**, followed by the time the document was authored (**Authoring Date**).
- The “**Order Priority**” and “**Requesting Client**” columns are **not** currently used for CDX documents.
- The “**Discipline**” column identifies the type of CDX document received.
- The “**Report status**” column displays the status of the document, which can be either
    - active (marks a preliminary document that may be updated),
    - completed (marks a final document), or
    - cancelled (marks a document that cancels and earlier one)
- The “**Ack**” column marks the acknowledgement status of a document.
