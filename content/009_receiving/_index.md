# Receiving and Routing

OSCAR BC has created a first version of OSCAR EMR that is CDX interoperable. This first version is capable of

1. **receiving** and displaying any of the approved types of CDX documents, e.g., eReferrals, Progress Notes, Patient Summaries, Discharge Summaries, General Purpose Notifications, Lab Results, etc.
2. **sending** eReferral requests to specialists connected to the CDX system.

In this chaper we walk you through the detailed steps of receiving and sending CDX documents.
