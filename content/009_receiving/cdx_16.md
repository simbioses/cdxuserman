CDX documents may also be related in ways other than versioning:

- a document may have a “parent document”
- documents may belong to the same “set of documents”
- a document may have been sent “in fulfillment of” another document (e.g., a consult not document may have been sent in fulfillment of an referral request document)

Any related CDX documents are displayed at the bottom of the CDX Viewer window:
