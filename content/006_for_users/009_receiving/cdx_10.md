As with other Inbox items, clicking on a CDX Document will open up a viewer window that shows the content of the document, including potential attachments (e.g., PDF documents, images, etc.). The CDX Document Viewer provides the familiar functionality of acknowledging a document, flagging / messaging other providers, etc. (see below).
