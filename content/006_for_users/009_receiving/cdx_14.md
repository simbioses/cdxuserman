Finally, the user may delete a CDX document that was received in error, e.g., if the patient named on the document is not (and will not be) a client of the clinic. (see “Delete” button)
Note: Documents that were deleted in error can be restored by an Admin (see [Administration chapter of this user manual](../018_administration/cdx_03/).).
