## Reply
CDX Composer allows user to respond back or reply to the incoming or received documents. 
> Inbox → Specific Message → Reply

Users can open any CDX document from the inbox to see a "Reply" button in the top right side as shown in the pic below.
After clicking on the reply button, user will be directed to the CDX Composer window with some pre-populated fields.
Users can add more information in the composer and send the document as a response to the incoming document.

Users can also view the detailed document to which they are responding by clicking the document type link inside "in response to {document type}" in the CDX composer as well as in the history page.
