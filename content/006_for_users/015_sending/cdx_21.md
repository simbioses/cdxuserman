The user can validate whether an e-referral was sent and delivered by viewing the left side bar of the e-referral. Sent documents are shown with the time and date they were sent to the CDX messaging system.

If a document has been sent to the CDX system but it has not been downloaded by the recipient clinic yet, OSCAR will show a cloud symbol instead of a check mark.
