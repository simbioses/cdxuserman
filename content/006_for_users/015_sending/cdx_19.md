## Sending e-Referral Requests

⚠️ The term “referral” is used to align with provincial standard terminology. OSCAR uses the term “consultation”. They can be considered synonymous in the following.

**Adding a CDX capable specialist**
E-referrals can only be sent to specialists that are connected to the CDX system. The “Add Specialist” UI has been extended to add CDX-capable specialists.

The new dialogue allows the user to search the CDX provider registry for providers to add to OSCAR. The search is based on any letters and returns all providers with these letters in their names.
