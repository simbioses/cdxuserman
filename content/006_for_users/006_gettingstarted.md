The CDX systems needs to be connected to the OBIB (*Oscar Bidirectional Interoperability Bus*) exchange data. You can check this in the CDX user interface in OSCAR's Admin panel.

> Admin → Integration → Clinical Data eXchange (CDX)

{{< figure title="CDX Configuration" src="/images/image001.png" width="100%">}}

The **CDX Status** tab indicates whether OSCAR is connected with an OBIB.

If the CDX Status tab indicates *The OBIB is not connected*, please contact your OSCAR Service Provider.

OSPs and administrators can find detailed steps about how to connect the OBIB in the [Administration chapter of this user manual](../018_administration/cdx_03/).
