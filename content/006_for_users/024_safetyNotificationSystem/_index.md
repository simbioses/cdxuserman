The safety notification system provides the user with the real-time status of the OSCAR by displaying the color-coded lights, and the detailed information on the unexpected scenarios and errors in the system related to the CDX and OBIB.

Notification lights can be seen in the top right corner as shown in the pic below, users can view all notifications by clicking on the light.

#### Notification types
Two types of notifications are generated namely, error and warning. 

**Error** is a type of notification generated by the high-severity failure points of the system which are critical and any failure or exception can lead to the failure of other critical components or functions of the system. For instance when OBIB is not connected to OSCAR.

**Warning** is a type of notification generated by the low-severity failure points of the system which are not critical but any failure or exception can lead to the failure of some non-critical component. For instance, automatic polling of CDX documents are disabled. 

#### Notification lights
**Green:** System is working fine without any error/warning.

**Yellow:** System is working fine with some warnings which might require some user attention.

**Red:** System is not working fine and requires urgent user attention.

#### Notification Display
All notifications with detailed information can be seen in a new window after clicking on the light on the main page.

**Generated at:** timestamp of the event.

**Generated during:** a specific function point of failure.

A user is also provided with functionality to dismiss or ignore any notification with a **’check to ignore’** checkbox. If a user chooses to dismiss any notification then the selected notifications will be removed from the display and time of dismissal, and the name of the user will be logged in the database to keep track of the dismissed notifications.
