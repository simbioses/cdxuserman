# Introduction

The *HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)* is a standard to communicate clinical documents electronically between provider systems.

The *Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA)* has partnered with other health authorities to establish CDA-based interoperability between clinical information systems, including primary care EMRs. This initiative uses the *Clinical Document eXchange (CDX)* communication system (https://bccdx.ca). The PHSA has worked with EMR vendors to implement CDX-based interoperability.

OSCAR BC has created a first version of OSCAR EMR that is CDX interoperable. This first version is capable of

1. **receiving** and displaying any of the approved types of CDX documents, e.g., eReferrals, Progress Notes, Patient Summaries, Discharge Summaries, General Purpose Notifications, Lab Results, etc.
2. **sending** eReferral requests to specialists connected to the CDX system.
