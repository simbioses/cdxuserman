	"content": " Introduction The HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is a standard to communicate clinical documents electronically between provider systems.\nThe Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) has partnered with other health authorities to establish CDA-based interoperability between clinical information systems, including primary care EMRs. This initiative uses the Clinical Document eXchange (CDX) communication system (https://bccdx.ca). The PHSA has worked with EMR vendors to implement CDX-based interoperability.\nOSCAR BC has created a first version of OSCAR EMR that is CDX interoperable. This first version is capable of\n receiving and displaying any of the approved types of CDX documents, e.g., eReferrals, Progress Notes, Patient Summaries, Discharge Summaries, General Purpose Notifications, Lab Results, etc. sending eReferral requests to specialists connected to the CDX system.
