	"content": " Introduction The HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is a standard to communicate clinical documents electronically between provider systems.\nThe Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) has partnered with other health authorities to establish CDA-based interoperability between clinical information systems, including primary care EMRs. This initiative uses the Clinical Document eXchange (CDX) communication system (https://bccdx.ca). The PHSA has worked with EMR vendors to implement CDX-based interoperability.\nOSCAR BC has created a first version of OSCAR EMR that is CDX interoperable. This first version is capable of\n receiving and displaying any of the approved types of CDX documents, e.g., eReferrals, Progress Notes, Patient Summaries, Discharge Summaries, General Purpose Notifications, Lab Results, etc. sending eReferral requests to specialists connected to the CDX system.

	"content": "CDX documents may identify several primary and secondary recipients (roughly analogous to the “To:” and “Cc:” fields in email.) CDX documents may also not specify any recipient provider - but just a recipient clinic.\nOSCAR’s CDX import engine uses the following logic to route incoming CDX documents to provider inboxes:\n (Step 1) route the document to the Inbox of any provider with the same MSP number as any of the recipients named in the document. (Step 2) if Step 1 did not result in any provider matches and if the patient named in the document could be matched to a demographic record in the EMR then route the document to the most responsible provider (MRP) of the matched patient (if available). (Step 3) if Steps 1 and 2 did not result in any provider matches, the document is considered “unclaimed\u0026rdquo; and can be retrieved by searching for “unclaimed” documents in the Inbox.  "

The “Add Specialist” UI has been extended to add CDX-capable specialists.\nThe new dialogue allows the user to search the CDX provider registry for providers to add to OSCAR. The search is based on any letters and returns all providers with these letters in their names.\nSimilarly, specialists can be updated. ⚠️ At this point, the CDX system does not provide the speciality of providers returned from its registry.

Manual download of “new” documents The CDX document distribution system considers documents as “new”, if and only if they have not yet been downloaded from the CDX system.\nOSCAR EMR can be configured to download “new” documents automatically. Hence, manual download of “new” documents is not needed during normal operations. However, it may be useful for testing purposes.\nThe Admin panel indicates the number of “new” documents waiting for a clinic. They can be downloaded manually using the import button (only visible if “new” documents are available).\nManual download of “old” documents The CDX document distribution system considers documents as “old” if the EMR system has downloaded them already. Still, the CDX system retains downloaded documents for an unspecified time, so that they can be downloaded again.\nWhy import a document that has already been downloaded?\nThis should be necessary only in two types of (exceptional) cases:\n Import Errors. If an error occurred during document import, the document is considered delivered (“old”) from the perspective of the CDX system. However, the document has not successfully been imported by the EMR. Once the problem has been diagnosed and fixed, the admin can use the CDX Admin panel to download the document(s) that could not be imported before (see below). Undo Document Deletion. EMR users have the ability to delete imported documents if they are convinced that the document was delivered in error. The CDX Admin panel allows a user to effectively undo such a manual deletion if it turns out that the document was deleted in error (see below).  The CDX Admin panel has a table showing those documents available from the CDX system that are not currently imported in the EMR. They can selectively be imported.\nThe figure below shows the CDX Admin panel indicating that there was one unsuccessful download and one document that was deleted. The user selected the unsuccessful download and can press the “*Import selected documents*” button to reattempt the import.\n"
